--PART LIST--
Here is a list of the main parts for this project:
- Raspberry Pi 3b+
- DFRobot motor driver hat, see https://wiki.dfrobot.com/DC_Motor_Driver_HAT_SKU_DFR0592
  - I think only the pins 39(Ground), 3(SDA1) and 5(SCL1) are used by this motor driver. The remaining pins can be used freely.
- 5MP camera for Raspberry Pi
- lightsensor
- Adafruit Micro Servo
